        <ul>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
          <li>The meta elements contain information about the page that is used by the browser.</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
          <li>The title element does not show up anywhere except the tab/title bar and can improve search engine rankings.</li>
          <li>The header element appears at the top of the page and usually contains a navigation menu and/or introductory content.</li>
          <li>The footer element appears at the bottom of the page and usually contains the author, copyright, contact, sitemap, and navigation.</li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
          <li>A selector defines the element or attributes to which the rules, or declarations, will apply.</li>
          <li>Declarations contain two important components: the CSS property we want to apply and the value of the property.</li>
          <li>Review the CSS box model.</li>
          <li>Class attributes allow us to share a CSS rule to any element we choose by assigning the rule to a class attribute with a class selector (i.e. card).</li>

        <ul>
          <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
          <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>
          <li>We can use Chrome DevTools to view console.log outputs.</li>
          <li>A value is considered 'falsy' if it is one of the following values: '0', '-0', 'On', '""', 'null', 'undefined', 'NaN',  or a Boolean data type with the value of 'false'. All other values are considered 'truthy'.</li>
          <li>An array is a single variable that is used to hold a group of data. They are typically used to hold data that is related in some way.</li>
          <li>A 'for' loop uses the predictable pattern of indices to perform a task on all the items in an array by allowing a single block of code to be executed over and over.</li>
          <li>A 'for' loop contains three important statements: for('starting point of loop', 'condition', 'what allows the array to iterate over each item').</li>
          <li>A function is a set of instructions that tells the computer how to perform a certain task.</li>
          <li>Declaring a function and executing a function are different; declaring a function creates a reusable block of code that performs a specific task, while executing a function actually runs the function in the spot we want it to.</li>
